# Reticulum WebRTC Demo (Sparse Mesh, TCP Gateway)

> **THIS PROJECT HAS ITS ROOTS IN AUTOGENERATED CODE BY CHATGPT** see [chatgpt conversation](./chatgpt_conversation.md)

This project implements a sparse Reticulum routing mesh using WebRTC between browsers and Node.js, including a TCP gateway that routes packets into and out of the Reticulum network.

---

## ðŸ§© Components

- **Browser peers**: Connect over WebRTC via a signaling server. Each maintains a routing table of 4 neighbors.
- **Node.js peers**: Join the mesh via WebRTC, and optionally bridge TCP connections.
- **TCP Gateway**: Forwards traffic from TCP clients to the Reticulum network and back.
- **Signaling Server**: Simple WebSocket-based signaling service.

## ðŸ§° Setup Instructions

1. Clone or extract the folder:
   ```bash
   cd reticulum-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the signaling server:
   ```bash
   node node/signaling-server.js
   ```

4. Start the Node.js peer with TCP gateway:
   ```bash
   node node/index.js
   ```

5. Open browser:
   - Launch `browser/index.html` in multiple browser tabs or devices.
   - Each browser joins a mesh room and displays neighbors + messaging UI.

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

- TCP clients â†’ Gateway â†’ Reticulum (over WebRTC)
- Reticulum (over WebRTC) â†’ Gateway â†’ TCP clients
- Routing follows sparse k-bucket logic (k = 4)

---

## ðŸ“¡ Notes

- All WebRTC signaling happens over `ws://localhost:8888`
- No full-mesh: links form only between best-fit neighbors
- Encryption and link management follow Reticulum's model

---

## ðŸ“ž Troubleshooting

- Check console logs in both browser and Node
- Ensure no firewall blocks TCP/WebSocket ports
- If you want to run signaling on another host, update WebSocket URLs
